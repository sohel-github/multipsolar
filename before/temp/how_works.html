    <p><b>Solar power panels generate electricity from sunlight.</b></p>
    <p>The roof mounted solar panels are made up of many photovoltaic (PV) cells. These cells collect the sunâ€™s light and convert the energy into DC current.</p>
    <p>This is fed through an inverter and converted to 240V AC electricity to power your home. The amount of electricity you can produce depends on the number and efficiency of the panels, the size of the inverter and the amount of sunlight in your location.</p>
    <p>Your home remains connected to the power grid so when you generate more electricity than you need you can feed it into the grid or purchase more from the grid when you are not producing enough to meet your requirements.</p>
    <p>As part of the installation you may need to upgrade your meter, your Solahart Expert will be able to advise you.</p>
